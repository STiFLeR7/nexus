"""``nexus_research`` — the Autonomous Research workflow (Capability Program 3).

A **consumer** of the Nexus control plane, not a platform extension: it composes the existing
engines into a complete research workflow and introduces no new architectural layer. Given a
research topic, the :class:`ResearchCoordinator` autonomously drives the full pipeline —

    Research Goal → Context → Knowledge → Planning → Research Work Packages → Orchestration
                  → Harness → Runtime Selection → Execution → Validation → Recovery
                  → Reflection → Knowledge → Research Brief

— using each engine's real entry point. Planning decomposes the topic (no special-case planner);
Runtime selection stays the Runtime Manager's; Validation judges every output; Recovery decides
governed continuations; Reflection surfaces reusable patterns; Knowledge persists them so a second
run's Planning improves through Knowledge consumption alone (INV-26).

Dependency direction: ``nexus_research`` sits above the integration layers it consumes
(``nexus_workflows``, ``nexus_runtime_adapters``) and every engine; it is imported by nothing. It
modifies no engine, contract, ADR, or invariant.
