"""Knowledge Candidate -- the immutable, advisory boundary contract Knowledge ingests (doc 02).

A :class:`KnowledgeCandidate` is the single input to the ingest pipeline: a *proposed* piece of
understanding together with everything needed to judge it -- its kind and subject (the basis of
the deterministic Subject Key, doc 03), its proposed statement, its confidence, its provenance,
and its supporting evidence **by id** (INV-27). Candidates are **advisory until accepted**
(INV-25): the Engine re-verifies provenance and evidence against policy and never persists a
candidate merely because it exists.

This is a **Knowledge-layer** value object, deliberately *not* imported from the Reflection
package: the candidate crosses the Reflection to Knowledge boundary **by value**, so
``nexus_knowledge`` imports only ``{nexus_core, nexus_infra}`` and no consumer can reach Reflection
through Knowledge (INV-26, structurally; doc 00, the G9 "adapt at the boundary" choice). The
orchestrating caller constructs a candidate from a Reflection Report's advisory outputs; Knowledge
never imports the producer.
