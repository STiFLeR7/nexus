"""Knowledge model -- the immutable Version record and the Item projection (doc 03/10).

The durable **Knowledge Item is the frozen core contract**
:class:`nexus_core.domain.Knowledge` (doc 03 -- "without inventing a competing model"): its
``identity`` is the deterministic Subject Key, and it is the *projection of the latest version*.
Because the core contract carries no version ordinal, the **version chain** -- the auditable
history of how understanding evolved -- is a Knowledge-layer value object,
:class:`KnowledgeVersion`. Each accepted change appends one immutable version; the current Item
is folded from the newest.

Nothing here is ever mutated in place: evolution, supersession, and expiration each produce a new
version and/or a new projected Item (ADR-001). Every reference is by id (INV-27); provenance only
grows across versions (INV-24).
