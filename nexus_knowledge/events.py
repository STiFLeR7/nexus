"""Knowledge events -- the ``knowledge.*`` facts the Knowledge Engine emits (doc 07).

Knowledge is **event-sourced** (ADR-001): the durable Item, its version chain, its lifecycle
state, and its freshness are all *projections* of an append-only ``knowledge.*`` stream. Each fact
is a canonical :class:`~nexus_core.domain.event.Event` with ``producer="knowledge"`` and
``source="nexus_knowledge"`` and a deterministic identifier carrying the ``know`` marker (doc 07),
so an ingestion replays identically and never collides with runtime / validation / recovery /
reflection events in the shared, correlated store.

Timestamps are the one captured-as-data, non-structural value (INV-17); their source is injected
so tests are reproducible and the produced *value objects* (Items / Versions) stay timestamp-free
in their identity. ``TimestampSource`` is reused from the runtime layer (Knowledge is downstream)
rather than re-declared, keeping one definition of the primitive.
