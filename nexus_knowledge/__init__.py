"""``nexus_knowledge`` -- the Knowledge Engine (deterministic, durable operational memory).

Knowledge is the **persistence layer** at the end of the intelligence pipeline. It consumes the
advisory Knowledge *Candidates* Reflection produces, judges each against a declarative Persistence
Policy, and either accepts it (creating or evolving a durable Knowledge Item), merges it into
existing understanding, or rejects it -- recording every decision as immutable, explainable audit.
It then serves the resulting Knowledge read-only to Planning, Context Engineering, and
Orchestration::

    Reflection --candidates (by value)--> Knowledge --read-only views--> Planning / Context

It **decides, preserves, evolves, expires, and serves** durable understanding; it never executes,
analyses, validates, retries, recovers, or evaluates governance policy (INV-25/INV-26/INV-28). The
durable Item is the frozen core ``Knowledge`` contract (doc 03 -- no competing model); its identity
is the deterministic Knowledge Subject Key, so the same lesson learned twice strengthens one Item
rather than fragmenting.

Dependency direction: ``nexus_knowledge -> {nexus_core, nexus_infra}`` only. It imports no upstream
layer (not Reflection) -- candidates cross the boundary **by value** -- so no consumer can reach
Reflection through Knowledge, preserving INV-26 structurally. It reuses the Phase 2 substrate
(event store, repositories, observability) without modifying it.
