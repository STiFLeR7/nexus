"""``nexus_briefings`` — the Nexus Briefings product (Product Program 1).

A **consumer** of the Nexus control plane, not a platform extension: it turns governed execution,
validated evidence, reflection, and knowledge into production-quality operational briefings, and
introduces no new architectural layer, engine, contract, ADR, or invariant. Given a brief type the
:class:`BriefingCoordinator` drives the full pipeline —

    Brief Request → Context → Knowledge → Planning → Execution → Validation → Recovery
                  → Reflection → Knowledge Update → Brief Composer → Rendered Brief

— using each engine's real entry point. Every product (Operational Digest, Research Brief,
Architecture Brief, Project Brief) is the same code path with different configuration. The
:class:`~nexus_briefings.composer.BriefComposer` composes each brief from validated artifacts,
recovery outcomes, reflection reports, and knowledge items — never from raw runtime output — and
the renderers project it to Markdown, HTML, or JSON.

Dependency direction: ``nexus_briefings`` sits above the integration layers it consumes
(``nexus_workflows``, ``nexus_runtime_adapters``) and every engine; it is imported by nothing. It
modifies no engine, contract, ADR, or invariant.
