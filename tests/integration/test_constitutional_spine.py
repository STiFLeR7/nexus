"""P13 — Constitutional Spine Fusion & Durable Pipeline (integration).

End-to-end proof that the single :class:`ConstitutionalPipeline` runs the complete constitutional spine
— Intent → Engineering → Context → Planning → Execution Actuation → Validation → Recovery → Reflection
→ Knowledge — as **one** deterministic, durable, restartable driver over a shared log, with real engines
throughout (no mocked stages). Closes the three P12 findings: F-1 (one Goal→Knowledge driver, no
competing path), F-2 (durable restart from the last completed constitutional boundary), F-3 (Execution
Actuation hands off cleanly to Validation via the frozen ExecutionResult contract).
