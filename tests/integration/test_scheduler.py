"""P16 — the Constitutional Scheduler & governed autonomy, end to end.

Proves the whole scheduling surface over the one shared log: one-time / recurring / delayed dispatch, a
restart that never double-dispatches, exact replay reconstruction, Policy-controlled auto-approval,
approval-required (governed) execution surfaced for a human, and scheduled platform operations — all
without changing any ownership (the pipeline runs the Goal, Policy governs, the Approval Exchange approves).
