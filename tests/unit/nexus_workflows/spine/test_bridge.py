"""P13 unit — the Execution Actuation → Validation seam (F-3).

Proves the additive ExecutionState→ExecutionResult projection is *faithful*: it recovers each node's
execution-session scope from the log so Validation's independent artifact corroboration (INV-20)
resolves exactly as it does for the incumbent per-session loop — PASSED, not PARTIAL — and it never
touches the actuator's contract.
