"""``nexus_orchestration`` — Phase 5 Orchestration Layer for Nexus v2.

The Orchestrator coordinates execution; it never performs it. Given a validated
Plan (its Execution Graph and Execution Strategy), it deterministically decides what
becomes executable, when dependencies are satisfied, when approvals are required,
what is waiting, and what has completed — then produces the runtime-independent
Harness Requests and Runtime Requests the next phase will act on::

    … → Planning → Execution Strategy → Orchestration → (Harness → Runtime)

It never executes work, edits repositories, plans, builds context, validates
outcomes, performs recovery, updates Knowledge, or invokes an LLM (doc 07
*Architectural Boundaries*). Runtime *allocation* is deferred to a later phase; the
Orchestrator produces requirements and candidates only (INV-37).

Determinism is a hard requirement: given identical Goal / Context Package / Plan /
Execution Graph / Strategy, the Orchestrator always produces an identical execution
queue, dependency state, approval state, harness requests, runtime requests, and
event stream. There is no AI and no randomness.

Dependency direction is one-way: ``nexus_orchestration → {nexus_infra,
nexus_core}``. It never imports ``nexus_planning`` or ``nexus_context`` — it
consumes their *outputs* (graph/strategy/context reference) by value/reference.
