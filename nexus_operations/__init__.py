"""``nexus_operations`` — the Constitutional Operations Plane (P15).

The sole constitutional owner of platform **observation** for operators: a read-only surface over the one
shared durable log. It projects active sessions, pipeline/execution status, the approval queue, and
runtime/replay/restart inventories; runs deterministic diagnostics; and derives a platform health summary
(recording it, optionally, as a durable ``operations.snapshot``). It **observes** — it never controls
execution, never mutates an engine, and produces no Supervision ``Observation`` domain object (INV-11).

Dependency direction is one-way: ``nexus_operations → {nexus_workflows.spine, nexus_approval, nexus_core,
nexus_infra}``; it imports no engine, introduces no contract/ADR/invariant, and modifies no owner.
