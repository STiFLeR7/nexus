"""Decision recorder — writes the three Recorded Shadow Adjudication facts (ADR-008 §3.2).

Emits ``migration.decision_recorded`` (the legacy DecisionRecord), ``migration.shadow_decision``
(the constitutional ShadowDecision), and ``migration.decision_diff`` (the classified DecisionDiff)
through the correlation gateway, all under the decision's correlation stream (INV-39), durable
and append-only (ADR-007/INV-13). It records; it never decides. Decision *values* are recorded
opaquely (the substrate has no business logic); callers pass serializable decision values.
