"""``nexus_integration`` — the constitutional Integration Substrate (P3).

Reusable migration primitives implementing **Recorded Shadow Adjudication** (ADR-008):
per constitutional owner, a legacy decision, its side-effect-free constitutional shadow,
and their determinism-class-classified diff are recorded as durable, correlated,
append-only ``migration.*`` events (ADR-007/INV-13/INV-39); authority is routed by a
per-owner feature flag (disabled → shadow → canary → enabled) and rolled back per owner
with one atomic flag write.

This layer **coordinates migration only** — it contains no business logic and never plans,
evaluates policy, executes, classifies intent, estimates, orchestrates, validates, or
recovers. It invokes injected ``legacy``/``shadow`` decision callables and records facts.
It depends only on ``nexus_core`` and ``nexus_infra`` (never on an engine), and integrates
through additive composition (:func:`build_integration`).
