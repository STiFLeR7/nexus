"""``nexus_runtime`` — Phase 8A Runtime Core for Nexus v2.

The Runtime Manager *prepares*; it never executes. Given the ``nexus_core``-projected
inputs of a batch of Execution Packages (:class:`RuntimeIntake`), it discovers runtimes
through the ``RUNTIME``-category Registry view, matches capabilities, filters health,
applies declarative policy, **allocates** exactly one runtime deterministically, and
creates a **Runtime Session** bound to it — driving the session to ``Ready``, the handoff
artifact for the Execution Engine::

    … → Harness → Execution Package → Runtime Manager → Runtime Session → Execution Engine

It never invokes a provider, launches a process, runs a Work Package, streams output,
validates an outcome, or performs recovery (doc 00 §5). The Runtime Manager is the
permanent preparation boundary between compilation and execution.

Determinism is a hard requirement: given identical intakes and an identical Registry
snapshot, RM always produces identical Runtime Sessions, Allocations, and event streams.
There is no AI and no randomness; identifiers are pure functions of the Execution Package
identity and the attempt ordinal (no timestamps in identifiers).

Dependency direction is one-way and strict: ``nexus_runtime → {nexus_core, nexus_infra}``
(doc 00 §4). It never imports ``nexus_planning``, ``nexus_context``,
``nexus_orchestration``, or ``nexus_harness``; it consumes their outputs by value/reference
through the :class:`RuntimeIntake` projection, and reuses the Phase 2 persistence mechanism
without modifying it.
