"""Default Policy and the v1 seed policy set — the policy "loader".

The **Default Policy** is the permanent, platform-level fail-closed rule (INV-30):
any *governed* action with no matching policy is denied. It is never weakened to
allow-by-default for governed actions (contract §8 *Default Policy is permanent*).

The **seed set** migrates Nexus v1's static governance defaults into structured,
data-driven policies (ADR-004 §9: "that table is the seed Policy set; migrate each
entry to a structured Policy"). The v1 values are transcribed here with provenance —
v2 never imports the v1 (``nexus``) package. Source of the values:
``nexus/core/policy_defaults.py`` (``ALLOWED_RUNTIMES``, ``GLOBAL_COMMAND_BLACKLIST``,
``REQUIRED_RUNTIME_POLICY``) enforced by ``nexus/execution/governance.py``.

**Verdict parity.** For the governed ``execution`` action class the seed set
reproduces v1's decision: allow when the runtime is approved, the runtime policy is
``approved``, and the command is not blacklisted; deny on any violation (v1 raised
``RepositoryGovernanceError`` — i.e. deny — on each of those checks).
