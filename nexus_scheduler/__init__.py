"""``nexus_scheduler`` — the Constitutional Scheduler & governed autonomy (P16).

The sole constitutional owner of execution **timing**. It determines *when* a Goal (or a platform
operation) enters the platform — deterministic one-time / delayed / immediate / interval / cron-like
schedules, durable and replayable, driven by an injected clock (never a wall clock). A due Goal is
dispatched through the Policy-mediated Autonomous Execution Coordinator (``Manual`` / ``Governed`` /
``Fully Automatic``) into the Constitutional Pipeline — the single execution coordinator; approvals stay
with the Approval Exchange and governance with Policy. Platform operations are dispatched through the
read-only Operations Plane. It records durable ``scheduler.*`` facts (producer ``scheduler``); replay
reconstructs the scheduling history exactly and a restart resumes without duplicate dispatch (INV-13/14/18).

Dependency direction is one-way: ``nexus_scheduler → {nexus_workflows.spine, nexus_approval,
nexus_operations, nexus_policy, nexus_core, nexus_infra}``. It reasons/plans/executes/validates/recovers
nothing, evaluates no policy (it delegates to the Policy engine), and modifies no owner.
