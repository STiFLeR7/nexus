"""The Constitutional Approval Exchange (P15) — sole owner of approval *coordination*.

:class:`ApprovalExchange` completes the governance loop around approval-gated execution. Execution
Actuation already pauses at an approval boundary (a gated node left WAITING); the exchange publishes the
approval request, awaits the operator's decision, records it as immutable audit (durable ``approval.*``
facts, INV-29), and — on approval — resumes execution by re-driving the **Constitutional Pipeline** with
the now-granted gate. It owns exactly the lifecycle ``Requested → Pending → Approved | Denied | Expired``.

It is deliberately *not* a coordinator of anything else: it never evaluates policy (Policy owns that,
INV-28 — the taxonomy that required the gate is the ExecutionStrategy's, authored by Planning/EI), never
executes work (Actuation owns traversal, INV-23 — the exchange hands resumption to the pipeline, which
drives Actuation), never plans, reasons, validates, or recovers. Its only sanctioned collaborator is the
Constitutional Pipeline (the single execution coordinator — no competing coordinator) and the shared
durable log; it imports no engine.
