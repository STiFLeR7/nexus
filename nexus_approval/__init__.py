"""``nexus_approval`` — the Constitutional Approval Exchange (P15).

The sole constitutional owner of approval **coordination**. Execution Actuation already pauses at an
approval boundary (a gated node left WAITING); the Approval Exchange completes the governance loop —
publishing the approval request, awaiting the operator decision, recording it as immutable audit (durable
``approval.*`` facts, producer ``approval_exchange``), and, on approval, resuming execution by re-driving
the Constitutional Pipeline with the now-granted gate. It owns the deterministic lifecycle
``Requested → Pending → Approved | Denied | Expired`` and nothing else: it never evaluates policy (INV-28),
executes (INV-23), plans, reasons, validates, or recovers.

Dependency direction is one-way: ``nexus_approval → {nexus_workflows.spine, nexus_core, nexus_infra}``; it
imports no engine, introduces no contract/ADR/invariant, and modifies no owner. Replay reconstructs the
identical approval history and a restart resumes an in-flight approval wait (INV-13/14/18).
