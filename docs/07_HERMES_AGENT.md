# Nexus References

Version: 0.1

Status: Required Reading

Project: Nexus

---

# Purpose

This document contains external references that may influence Nexus architecture, implementation, workflows, and operational design.

References are provided to:

* Accelerate development
* Avoid reinventing proven solutions
* Learn from existing systems
* Evaluate reusable patterns

References are not architecture.

References are not requirements.

References are not source of truth.

The source of truth remains:

* 00_BRIEF.md
* 01_ARCHITECTURE.md
* 02_TECH_STACK.md
* 03_AGENT_DESIGN.md
* 04_CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md
* 05_INTEGRATION_SPECS.md
* 06_DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md
* RULES.md

# Reference Evaluation Policy

For every reference:

Required:

1. Analyze
2. Extract useful patterns
3. Compare against Nexus architecture
4. Document findings
5. Decide whether to adopt

Forbidden:

Blind copying

Blind dependency adoption

Architecture replacement

Framework worship

Every external system must justify its inclusion.

# Reference 2

Hermes Agent

Repository:

https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent

Category:

Agent Runtime

Priority:

Critical

Status:

Mandatory Evaluation

---

## Environment Note

Hermes Agent is already installed locally.

Available from terminal:

PowerShell:

hermes

Command Prompt:

hermes

This means Hermes can be treated as an available runtime rather than a future dependency.

---

## Why It Matters

Hermes Agent provides an existing agent execution environment.

Potential capabilities:

* Agent execution
* Tool calling
* Task execution
* Workflow automation
* Runtime management

Rather than building everything from scratch, Nexus should evaluate whether Hermes can act as a worker runtime.

---

## Evaluation Goals

Determine:

Can Hermes act as:

Research Agent?

Planning Agent?

Execution Agent?

Task Worker?

Background Worker?

Autonomous Runtime?

Tool Executor?

---

## Architectural Position

Possible Future Architecture

```

In this model:

Nexus remains orchestrator.

Hermes remains runtime.

Governance remains inside Nexus.

---

## Critical Constraint

Hermes must never become the source of truth.

Hermes must never own:

Approvals

Memory

Governance

Task Authority

Execution Authorization

Those responsibilities remain inside Nexus.

---

## Required Investigation

Document:

Installation method

CLI interface

Execution model

Configuration model

State model

Memory model

Tool calling capabilities

Logging capabilities

Extensibility

Failure recovery

Runtime characteristics

---

## Decision Outcomes

Option A

Primary Runtime

Option B

Secondary Runtime

Option C

Specialized Runtime

Option D

Rejected

Decision must be documented.

Priority:

Medium

---

## Purpose

Study existing orchestration systems.

Focus:

Control planes

Workflow engines

Task schedulers

State machines

Distributed orchestration

Agent runtimes

---

## Rule

Borrow ideas.

Do not borrow complexity.

Nexus should remain simple.

---

# Reference Documentation Requirement

Every evaluated reference must generate:

Reference Report

Containing:

Summary

Strengths

Weaknesses

Architectural Fit

Adoption Recommendation

Decision

No reference should be adopted without evaluation.

---

# Architectural Reminder

Nexus is not attempting to compete with:

Gemini CLI

Claude Code

Hermes Agent

Pi

OpenRouter

Those systems are capabilities.

Nexus is the orchestrator that coordinates them.

---

# Final Principle

References provide options.

Architecture provides direction.

Nexus should learn from existing systems while remaining opinionated, deterministic, governed, and memory-driven.

External tools are replaceable.

Nexus remains authoritative.
