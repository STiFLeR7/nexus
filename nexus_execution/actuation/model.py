"""Execution-actuation value models — the immutable ExecutionState projection and driver inputs.

Execution Actuation drives the frozen Plan through its Execution Graph. Its output is one immutable
:class:`ExecutionState`: a deterministic **projection** of the ``execution.*`` event log (INV-13/14) —
never a new frozen domain object (INV-07). :class:`NodeState` is the per-node projection;
:class:`ActuationInputs` is the read-only bundle the driver consumes — the frozen ``Plan`` + its sibling
``ExecutionGraph`` + governing ``ExecutionStrategy`` + owned ``WorkPackage`` set, all by value (the P10
``ExecutionPlan``'s constituents). The ``execution.*`` event-type constants are the traversal's durable
facts; the namespace is additive (no incumbent emits under it).
