"""``nexus_execution`` — the minimal Execution Engine for the Runtime vertical slice.

The Execution Engine **performs** what the Runtime Manager **prepared** (doc 00 §1/§8):
given a ``Ready`` Runtime Session and a :class:`RuntimeAdapter`, it starts the runtime,
consumes the adapter's ordered signals, records canonical ``runtime.*`` events, honors
cancellation/timeout, collects artifacts by reference, maps failures onto the doc-11 error
model, runs cleanup, and returns an :class:`ExecutionResult` — reaching ``Destroyed``::

    … → Runtime Manager → Runtime Session (Ready) → Execution Engine → Runtime Adapter
        → Runtime → Execution Result

This package is **generic**: it imports no provider and branches on none. The concrete
:class:`RuntimeAdapter` protocol here is the materialization of doc 03's conceptual
nine-concern contract; provider-specific behavior lives only in an *implementation* of it
(e.g. ``nexus_runtime_claude``). Dependency direction:
``nexus_execution → {nexus_runtime, nexus_core, nexus_infra}`` — it consumes RM's Runtime
Session downstream and reuses the Phase 2 substrate without modifying it.
