"""Decision evaluation — aggregating rule results into a deterministic verdict.

Milestone 2 (aggregation). A pure function of the :class:`RuleResult` list — no AI, no
randomness. The precedence encodes the INV-20 policy ratified for this program: a runtime
self-report alone never passes; a clean run must be corroborated by an independent artifact,
and a clean run *without* corroboration (and without explicit criteria) is **Partial**, not
Passed.

Confidence is a deterministic "evidence-corroboration strength": the fraction of *applicable*
rules that were satisfied. It is explainable (every rule contributes) and reproducible.
