"""Validation vocabularies — the closed enumerations and reference tags of the layer.

The **decision vocabulary is doc-14 canon**: ``Passed / Failed / Partial / Requires Review``
(the program prompt's "Success / Failure / Partial Success / Inconclusive" are informal
synonyms mapped 1:1 — see ``docs/runtime/validation/VALIDATION_RULES.md``). The lifecycle
stages are doc-14's Validation States; the automated engine drives the deterministic subset
and reaches ``Requires Review`` where doc 14 would await human review (the human workflow is
a later phase, not implemented here).

There is no frozen core contract for Evidence or a Validation Report — Evidence is *produced
by Validation* (INV-12) and the Report is a Validation output, so both are Validation-layer
value objects (the same pattern as the Runtime Session). Only the closed vocabularies and
canonical ``Reference`` ``target_type`` strings live here.
