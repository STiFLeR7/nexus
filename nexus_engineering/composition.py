"""Engineering composition — dependency-injection wiring for Engineering Intelligence.

Mirrors ``build_estimation`` / ``build_policy``: it **reuses** the P1 substrate unchanged (emitter
= the infrastructure context, repository = a reused ``InMemoryRepository``, metrics = the context's
observability). Integration is additive DI only; no engine is modified. Durable persistence is
transparent over ``build_durable_infrastructure`` (ADR-007).

:meth:`EngineeringContext.strategize_for_goal` is where EI **consumes** its upstream inputs: it
queries the Estimation Engine (which *feeds* EI) for a report and the Policy Engine (the sole
evaluator — INV-28) via side-effect-free ``simulate`` for the governance ceiling, then reasons.
EI never evaluates policy and never estimates quantitatively — it delegates to their owners and
consumes the results (INV-02).
