"""``nexus_engineering`` — the constitutional Engineering Intelligence subsystem (P5, the Reason capability).

The **single owner of engineering reasoning** (Constitution Article IV; INV-02). Given immutable,
read-only inputs — a Goal (from Intent Resolution), an Estimation Report (Estimation feeds EI), a
Policy ceiling (the sole evaluator — INV-28), Knowledge, Repository Understanding, Operator
Preferences, and Environment Facts — the :class:`~nexus_engineering.engine.EngineeringIntelligence`
**reasons** and produces exactly one immutable, explainable
:class:`~nexus_engineering.model.EngineeringStrategy`: how the work should proceed.

It reasons; it **never executes** — it plans no work packages, schedules nothing, selects no
runtime, resolves no Skill, evaluates no policy, estimates nothing quantitatively, validates
nothing, recovers nothing, and persists no Knowledge (`engineering/01`, `03`). Every recommendation
is intent-bearing (not instruction-bearing) and self-explaining: reasoning chain, contributing
evidence, assumptions, confidence, and its policy / estimation / knowledge influences (INV-31).

Reasoning passes through the determinism seam (INV-17): the reasoner (pluggable — an LLM reasoner
attaches behind :class:`~nexus_engineering.reasoner.Reasoner`; the default is deterministic) reasons
once, the engine records one ``engineering.strategized`` fact embedding the Strategy, and replay
reconstructs the decision without re-inference. It reuses the P1/P2/P4 substrate and integrates
through additive composition (:func:`build_engineering`).
