"""Grounded planning value models — the immutable inputs and the assembled ExecutionPlan.

:class:`PlanningInputs` is the read-only bundle of the three canonical inputs (Goal +
EngineeringStrategy + ContextPackage, all consumed by value). :class:`ExecutionPlan` is the P10
output: the frozen ``Plan`` (which references its sibling Execution Graph by id and owns its Work
Packages — INV-10) bundled with the Execution Strategy, resolved capabilities, a deterministic
:class:`CoordinationView`, and the context references, as a frozen **value** — not a second Plan
schema (INV-07). It serializes into a ``planning.execution_plan_assembled`` fact so replay
reconstructs it without re-planning.
