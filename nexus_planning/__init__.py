"""``nexus_planning`` — Phase 3 Planning Layer for Nexus v2.

The first operational-intelligence component built on the infrastructure
substrate (``nexus_infra``). Planning converts a validated **Goal** into a
complete, immutable, deterministic execution structure: a **Plan**, its **Work
Packages**, an **Execution Graph**, an **Execution Strategy**, and a **Capability
requirement set**.

Planning **prepares** work; it never performs it. Per the architectural
invariants it never executes, supervises, validates, selects a runtime, allocates
a provider, or performs recovery (INV-03, INV-37). Those belong to later phases.

Determinism is a hard requirement: identical Goals with identical planning inputs
produce byte-identical Plans, Work Packages, and Execution Graphs. There is no AI
reasoning, prompt engineering, or LLM call here — the decomposition arrives as
explicit structured input and Planning assembles it mechanically. The seam for a
future intelligent decomposer is :class:`~nexus_planning.decomposition.DecompositionStrategy`.

Dependency direction is one-way: ``nexus_planning → {nexus_infra, nexus_core}``.
