"""Strategy binding — where Planning **consumes** the Engineering Strategy (P6).

The Constitution permits "Plan may depend on the Engineering Strategy": Engineering Intelligence
*authors* the engineering postures (execution style, approval, recovery, validation, runtime
capabilities); Planning *consumes* them and decomposes within them. This module maps the immutable
:class:`~nexus_engineering.model.EngineeringStrategy` facets onto the Planning input surface — the
optional hints on :class:`~nexus_planning.requests.PlanningRequest` that :class:`StrategyAssigner`
already prefers over its own derivation. It performs **no engineering reasoning**: it reads the
Strategy's already-decided facet values and translates them into Planning's vocabulary.

This is the design's compatibility property: EI adds a *producer* of the postures, not a mutation of
Planning. The decomposition algorithm is untouched; only the *source* of the postures moves from
operator/topology to the Engineering Strategy.
