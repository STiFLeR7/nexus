"""``nexus_human_interaction`` — the first constitutional Human Interaction surface (P14/B).

A **façade** over the constitutional platform, not a UI framework. An operator submits a Goal, inspects
pipeline status / execution history / execution graph / Knowledge, replays and restarts sessions, and has
execution lineage explained — and every operation invokes **only** the
:class:`~nexus_workflows.spine.ConstitutionalPipeline`. No engine is directly user-callable; the façade
owns request translation, response formatting, session lookup, and progress reporting, and owns **no
reasoning**. It records its own durable ``interaction.*`` facts (producer ``human_interaction``) so an
operator session replays exactly and a restart resumes without replaying completed constitutional stages.

Dependency direction is one-way: ``nexus_human_interaction → {nexus_workflows.spine, nexus_core,
nexus_infra}``; it imports and orchestrates no engine, introduces no contract/ADR/invariant, and modifies
no owner.
