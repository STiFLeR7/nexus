"""07 - Approval Exchange: a gated node pauses execution, an operator decision resumes it.

A Work Item marked `requires_approval` becomes an approval gate in the compiled plan.
Actuation runs everything up to that gate, then pauses (the pipeline reaches `PAUSED`,
not `COMPLETED`) instead of executing the gated node. The Approval Exchange is the sole
owner of what happens next: publish the pending request, record the operator's decision,
and - only on approval - resume the exact same pipeline run with that gate now authorized.

Lifecycle demonstrated: Requested -> Pending -> Approved -> Execution (resumed).

See README.md in this directory for the full walkthrough.
