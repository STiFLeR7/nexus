"""03 - Policy Governance: one decision, evaluated twice, two different verdicts.

Demonstrates the Policy Engine standalone - the single, fail-closed governance owner every
other subsystem consults before acting (INV-30: an action with no matching policy is denied,
never allowed). Uses the platform's own seeded default policies (migrated from Nexus v1's
static governance table, ADR-004 SS9) rather than inventing a new rule.

See README.md in this directory for the full walkthrough.
