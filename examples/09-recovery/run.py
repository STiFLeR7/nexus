"""09 - Recovery: a failed execution still reaches a deterministic, governed outcome.

`SpineRequest(fail=True)` routes the default runtime's stub invoker down its failure path -
the same seam RC1/RC2's own regression tests use to prove recovery behavior, not a bespoke
failure injection invented for this example. The pipeline does NOT stop at the failure:
Validation judges the execution against evidence (deciding "failed", not trusting a runtime's
own claim), Recovery classifies that failure and decides a bounded continuation, and the
pipeline still reaches Knowledge - recording what was learned from the failure itself.

Highlights why this differs from a simple agent framework: a failure is not a crash, an
unhandled exception, or a silently dropped run - it is itself a governed, recorded outcome.

See README.md in this directory for the full walkthrough.
