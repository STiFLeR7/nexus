"""Intent Resolution value objects — the Understand capability's inputs and outputs.

Intent Resolution owns understanding *what the operator wants* (`docs/v2/16`; frozen
``contracts/intent.md``). Its canonical artifact is the **frozen** :class:`~nexus_core.domain.intent.Intent`
(the one schema for an operator request / resolved intent — INV-07) and, when resolved, a frozen
:class:`~nexus_core.domain.goal.Goal`. This module adds no competing representation of intent: the
:class:`IntentAnalysis` result **bundles** those frozen objects (the way ``PlanningResult`` bundles
``Plan``/graph), and :class:`ClarificationRequest` is the *typed* form of the entries the frozen
Intent already carries as open ``clarification_requests`` Structs.

Every output is immutable and deterministic (identical request → identical analysis → identical id).
