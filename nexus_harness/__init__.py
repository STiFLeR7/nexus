"""``nexus_harness`` — Phase 6 Harness Layer for Nexus v2.

The Harness *compiles*; it never executes. Given the Harness Requests an
Orchestration cycle produced, it validates them and resolves their Skills,
Capabilities, Policies, Context, and Artifacts into immutable, runtime-ready
**Execution Packages** and descriptive **Execution Manifests** — the final
preparation stage before runtime selection and execution::

    … → Orchestration → Harness → Execution Package → Runtime Manager → Execution Engine

It never invokes AI, edits the repositories it reads from, runs a shell command,
allocates a runtime, executes a Work Package, performs recovery, or validates an
outcome (doc 11 *Architectural Boundaries*). The Harness is the permanent compilation
boundary between orchestration and execution.

Determinism is a hard requirement: given identical Harness Requests and identical
resolution sources, the Harness always produces identical Execution Packages,
Execution Manifests, and event streams. There is no AI and no randomness; identifiers
are pure functions of the Harness Request identities (no timestamps in identifiers).

Dependency direction is one-way: ``nexus_harness → {nexus_orchestration, nexus_infra,
nexus_core}``. It consumes Orchestration's Harness Requests by value/reference and
reuses the Phase 2 persistence mechanism without modifying it.
