"""The constitutional learning integration (P14/A) — governed, deterministic Knowledge grounding.

The platform records Knowledge (Reflection → Knowledge). P14 closes the loop: prior Knowledge becomes
an **optional, governed** grounding input to future executions, flowing **Knowledge → Engineering →
Context → Planning** — never directly into Planning (INV-26), never owned by anyone but the Knowledge
engine (read-only serve).

:class:`KnowledgeSelector` is the deterministic selector:

1. **retrieve** — ``knowledge.serve(query)`` (read-only, stable order — INV-16); the Knowledge engine
   remains the sole owner and decides what matches;
2. **govern** — the Policy engine (sole evaluator — INV-28) evaluates a ``knowledge_grounding`` decision;
   admitted only when governance allows. This is a *governed* action class permitted by an explicit,
   overridable allow-baseline policy (mirroring ``policy.execution.allow-baseline``) — a deny policy
   filters grounding out. No bypass, fail-closed-consistent (INV-30).

The output :class:`KnowledgeSelection` carries the admitted Knowledge (fed to Engineering's ``knowledge``
input and the P9 grounded-Context ``GroundingInputs.knowledge`` — INV-06) plus **references-only**
provenance (subject, kind, governance verdict + trace, selected ids). Selection is a pure function of the
Knowledge store + Goal + Policy, so it is deterministic and replayable; it mutates no Knowledge and does
no semantic/LLM ranking.
