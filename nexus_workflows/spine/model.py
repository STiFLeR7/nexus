"""Constitutional-spine value models — the pipeline stages, events, session projection, and outcome.

The constitutional pipeline coordinates the constitutional *owners* in order (Understand → Reason →
Contextualize → Plan → Actuate → Validate → Recover → Reflect → Learn) and owns none of their
behavior. Its own durable facts are the additive ``pipeline.*`` events; the :class:`PipelineSession`
is a **projection** of that stream (INV-13/14 — the log is truth, the session is derived), never a
new frozen domain object (INV-07). :class:`SpineRequest` is the text-first pipeline input (Intent
resolves it into a Goal); :class:`SpineRun` is the immutable outcome; :class:`SpineControl` bounds a
run for graceful stop + restart demonstration.
