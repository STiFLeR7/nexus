"""Constitutional-pipeline composition — wire the whole spine over one shared infrastructure.

Assembles the single Goal→Knowledge driver additively from existing composition roots, all over one
:class:`~nexus_infra.InfrastructureContext` (durable transparently over ``build_durable_infrastructure``
— ADR-007), so every constitutional owner appends to one authoritative log and one injected clock:

* the front reasoning owners — Intent, Engineering, Estimation, Policy (``now``-clocked);
* grounded Planning (P10) — consumes the Engineering Strategy + Context Package by value;
* the incumbent :class:`~nexus_workflows.pipeline.Pipeline` — **reused** (via the F-2 durable seam) for
  Context Engineering and the Validate→Learn back chain (Validation/Recovery/Reflection/Knowledge);
* Execution Actuation (P11) — built per run by the coordinator, so a restart re-registers its runtime
  over the reopened log.

It redesigns nothing and modifies no owner: it is DI wiring only.
