"""PipelineBuilder -- assemble every existing engine over one shared substrate (Milestone 1).

The builder wires the ten implemented engines (Context Engineering, Planning, Orchestration,
Harness, Runtime, Execution, Validation, Recovery, Reflection, Knowledge) over a single
:class:`InfrastructureContext` and a single injected ``TimestampSource`` -- so every engine appends
to one authoritative event log and one deterministic clock (ADR-001, INV-17). It orchestrates
existing engines only; it contains **no business logic** and redesigns nothing.

A :class:`Pipeline` is one execution's wiring: engine ids are deterministic per Goal, so a pipeline
hosts one workflow execution. To carry learning across executions (Milestone 5), pass a shared
``knowledge_repositories`` so two pipelines serve and accept against the same durable Knowledge
store while keeping fully independent event logs.
