"""``nexus_workflows`` -- end-to-end operational workflow integration (Capability Program 1).

This package proves the Nexus control plane functions as **one coherent system**: it composes the
ten independently-built engines into a complete execution flow, using only their existing public
APIs, redesigning nothing::

    Goal -> Context -> Plan -> Work Packages -> Execution Graph -> Harness -> Runtime
         -> Execution -> Validation -> Recovery -> Reflection -> Knowledge

It introduces no new architecture, engine, contract, ADR, or invariant. It contains three
orchestration primitives (Milestone 1) -- :class:`PipelineBuilder` (wire every engine over one
shared infrastructure + clock), :class:`WorkflowCoordinator` (drive the engines in order for one
request, recording a cross-layer timeline), and :class:`PipelineExecutor` (run + replay from the
event log) -- plus a deterministic reference workflow and the one sanctioned Harness->Runtime
projection.

Dependency direction: ``nexus_workflows`` sits above every engine (it is the integration boundary,
so it may import them all) and is imported by nothing. It preserves INV-26 structurally: the
learning loop reaches Planning only through a read-only Knowledge query, never through Reflection.
