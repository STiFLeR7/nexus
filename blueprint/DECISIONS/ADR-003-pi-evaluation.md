# ADR-003: Pi Evaluation Requirement and Sequencing

Date: 2026-06-19
Status: Open — Evaluation Required

---

## Context

Multiple Nexus documents (00_BRIEF, 03_AGENT_DESIGN, 05_CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS, 06_DEVELOPMENT_PHASES, 07_REFERENCES, RULES) mandate evaluation of:

```
https://github.com/earendil-works/pi
```

The constraint is explicit:

> Before implementing orchestration primitives, evaluate Pi.
> Do not rebuild capabilities without evaluation.

However, the documented Phase 8 placement creates a sequencing risk: Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure) builds the Workflow Orchestrator before Pi is evaluated.

---

## Problem

**Sequencing Conflict:**

```
Phase 0  — Foundation (No orchestration)
Phase 1  — Core Infrastructure (Builds Workflow Orchestrator ← CONFLICT)
...
Phase 8  — Pi Evaluation
```

If Pi is evaluated in Phase 8 and found to be a good fit, the Phase 1 Workflow Orchestrator may need to be replaced — creating significant rework.

**Constraint 25 is unambiguous:**

> Before implementing orchestration primitives:
> Evaluate https://github.com/earendil-works/pi

---

## Decision

**Proposed Resolution:**

Run Pi evaluation as a **Phase 0 parallel track**, not Phase 8.

Pi evaluation findings must be available before Phase 1 design begins.

**Evaluation Questions:**

1. Can Pi provide workflow execution?
2. Can Pi provide state management?
3. Can Pi provide agent orchestration?
4. Can Pi provide task coordination?
5. Can Pi provide scheduling primitives?
6. Can Pi provide failure recovery?
7. Can Pi provide persistence?
8. Can Pi provide observability?

**Decision Outcomes:**

| Option | Description | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Option A | Adopt Pi as orchestration layer | Phase 1 design changes significantly |
| Option B | Partial integration | Selective adoption, custom gaps |
| Option C | Reject | Proceed with custom orchestrator |

---

## Required Action

1. Clone https://github.com/earendil-works/pi
2. Analyze architecture, APIs, and state model
3. Map Pi capabilities against Nexus requirements
4. Document findings in `blueprint/references/pi-evaluation.md`
5. Make a decision before Phase 1 begins

## Status

**Open — Evaluation Required**

This ADR will be updated with conclusions after evaluation.
