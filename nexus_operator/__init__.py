"""``nexus_operator`` — the Nexus Operator Experience (Productization Program 1).

The operational interface over the existing platform: a human operates Nexus through one coherent
:class:`OperatorSession` without invoking engines directly. It is a **consumer** — it introduces no
new engine, contract, ADR, or invariant, and every capability consumes existing public APIs:

* **submit a Goal** and drive the full pipeline (Context → … → Knowledge → Briefings);
* **monitor** via a unified :class:`OperationalTimeline` where every entry links to persisted
  evidence (Milestone 2);
* **inspect** Goals, Plans, Work Packages, Runtime Sessions, Validation Reports, Recovery Plans,
  Reflection Reports, Knowledge Items, and Briefings through a read-only
  :class:`OperationalExplorer` (Milestone 3);
* **search** Goals, Knowledge, Briefings, and Validation Reports deterministically — no vectors, no
  embeddings (Milestone 4);
* review an :class:`OperationalDashboard` aggregated entirely from persisted state (Milestone 5).

Dependency direction: ``nexus_operator`` sits above the integration layers it consumes
(``nexus_workflows``, ``nexus_runtime_adapters``, ``nexus_briefings``) and every engine; it is
imported by nothing. It modifies no engine, contract, ADR, or invariant.
